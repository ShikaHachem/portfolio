## Summary

Vermiglio is one of those films that sticks with you long after it&apos;s over. Directed by Maura Delpero, it&apos;s set in a small Italian village just after World War II. While the village might seem isolated, the war&apos;s effects are still felt, creeping in through deserters, changing lives, and shifting histories. The story focuses on Grazia Dei (played by Tommaso Ragno), a schoolteacher who unintentionally becomes a catalyst for change in the community. Through his eyes, and those of three sisters (his daughters), we get a look at a society at a crossroads, struggling to hold onto old traditions while the world outside demands change.

## Themes

What makes Vermiglio stand out is that it&apos;s not just about the aftermath of war, it&apos;s about transformation. It explores education, class struggles, faith, and self-discovery. Grazia Dei is a symbol of hope for the future, pushing back against the illiteracy and superstition that hold the town back. The three sisters each represent different stages of growth, and you watch them slowly rebel against the roles they&apos;ve been forced into. It&apos;s not the loud kind of rebellion, but more of a quiet, feminine power that shapes the world around them in subtle ways.

Maura Delpero&apos;s storytelling feels personal but also universally relatable. Instead of big, dramatic battle scenes, the "war" here is fought in classrooms, around dinner tables, and in whispered conversations. It&apos;s not just about surviving physically, it&apos;s about surviving emotionally and culturally. The film makes you reflect on how a community&apos;s resilience can carry them through even the toughest times.

## Performances

Tommaso Ragno is fantastic as Grazia Dei. He&apos;s not just playing a teacher, he&apos;s playing a man trying to push a community forward, even though they&apos;re not quite ready for it. He&apos;s flawed, stubborn, and very human in his pursuit of change. The three sisters are equally impressive. They&apos;re each at a different stage of coming-of-age, figuring out who they are in a world that&apos;s changing faster than they can keep up. The performances feel so real, like you&apos;re watching young women wrestling with their identities in a world that doesn&apos;t know what to do with them.

The supporting cast adds an extra layer of realism, especially since many of the villagers are played by local actors. It&apos;s not like a film set in the past, it feels like you&apos;re peeking into a forgotten moment in history.

## Personal Take

Honestly, Vermiglio is the kind of film that doesn&apos;t fit into a neat box. It moves slowly, and it asks you to listen, not just watch. It&apos;s not about big dramatic moments—rather, it&apos;s about small, powerful details: a lingering glance, a letter written in shaky handwriting, a prayer whispered in quiet defiance. It&apos;s hard to define, but if you let it sink in, it gets under your skin in a way that&apos;s tough to shake off.

It&apos;s a slow burn, so if you&apos;re the type who loves fast-paced plots, it might feel a bit boring. But if you enjoy films that explore history through personal stories, Vermiglio is worth the time. It makes you reflect on what it means to change, and when it does, it leaves a lasting impression.

## Rating (out of 10)

I&apos;d give it an 8.5/10. It&apos;s beautifully shot, emotionally deep, and immersive. But it&apos;s not for everyone. If you prefer fast action or big drama, it might not be your thing. But if you appreciate quieter, more reflective films that focus on mood and emotion, Vermiglio will stick with you long after the credits roll.

## Film Analysis: Vermiglio (2022)

### Analyzing Isolation, Memory, and Female Resilience in Vermiglio

If you&apos;ve seen Vermiglio (and if you haven&apos;t, be warned, spoilers ahead!), you know it&apos;s one of those films that sticks with you long after the credits roll. Directed by Maura Delpero, it&apos;s a hauntingly beautiful exploration of grief, tradition, and the weight of memory. The film speaks in silences, in absences, where the past lingers like a ghost in every corner of the present.

Set in a remote Italian village after World War II, Vermiglio follows three sisters living in a world where men have either died or disappeared, leaving behind an existence shaped by rituals, quiet resistance, and the heavy, unspoken pain of a generation struggling to find its place in a new reality.

### The Weight of Absence and Memory

From the opening shots, Vermiglio is soaked in absence. The landscape is vast and empty, and the silence is deafening. The sisters&apos; lives are defined by what is no longer there: men, certainty, and the life they once knew. This absence isn&apos;t just a backdrop, it&apos;s the emotional core of the film. The war might have ended, but its presence is felt in the way the sisters move through the world, carrying a grief that they don&apos;t always express openly. Their home, their routines, even the way they interact with the villagers, all of it feels haunted by what&apos;s missing.

Delpero uses this absence to explore how memory shapes identity. The sisters are grieving not just personal loss, but a way of life that has been irrevocably changed. Their identities are tied to the men who are gone, forcing them to confront the question of what it means to exist in a world that no longer has room for them in the same way. And the village itself feels frozen in time, stuck between the past and the present. There&apos;s this feeling that moving forward is impossible when the past is so deeply embedded in the land and the people.

### Women and the Burden of Tradition

At its heart, Vermiglio is about women navigating a world that was never truly built for them. The sisters must find a way to forge their own identities in a society that once defined their roles through their relationships with men as daughters, wives, and mothers. Now, without those roles, they must carve out their own space, and the struggle to do so is felt in every frame.

Each sister represents a different response to this new reality:

- The eldest clings to tradition, keeping the old rituals alive in an effort to preserve order in a world that feels off balance. She carries the weight of expectations and the past, holding on because it&apos;s the only thing she knows.
- The middle sister resists tradition, pushing against the norms and questioning what&apos;s left of the world she&apos;s known. She embodies frustration, longing for change but unsure how to bring it about.
- The youngest is caught somewhere in between, torn between the past and the possibilities of the future. She represents uncertainty, stuck in that space where the future feels both possible and unreachable.

There&apos;s a quiet tension between them as they try to find their way, love each other, and deal with their grief in different ways. Their interactions—those glances, the small gestures, the moments of silence—are powerful because they communicate so much without words.

The film also critiques the way women are expected to bear grief differently. While the men went off to fight, the women were left behind to endure in silence. Their pain isn&apos;t celebrated or acknowledged in the same way, it&apos;s quiet, internalized, and often dismissed. Delpero makes this clear in how the village treats the sisters: there&apos;s this expectation that they will simply keep going, that they will continue to run the household and suffer without complaint. But beneath this expectation is an unspoken question: What happens when the world no longer needs you the way it once did?

### Nature as a Reflection of the Self

The landscape in Vermiglio isn&apos;t just a setting, it&apos;s a reflection of the emotional landscape of the characters. The mountains, the empty fields, the changing seasons—they all mirror the emotional states of the sisters. The vastness of the land emphasizes their isolation. It&apos;s beautiful, but it also feels deeply lonely. Surrounded by nature, the sisters still can&apos;t escape their circumstances. They&apos;re trapped in this place that feels at once too big and too small, too empty and too full of memories.

The weather and the light are key players in this story. Harsh winters contrast with fleeting moments of warmth, much like the emotional journey of the sisters. The fog and shadows add a ghostly quality, reinforcing the idea that the past never really leaves. It&apos;s always there, just out of reach, hanging over everything.

### A Slow, Meditative Exploration of Grief

Vermiglio doesn&apos;t follow a typical narrative. It moves like a memory—fragmented, nonlinear, and full of quiet moments that build over time. The slow pacing might not be for everyone, but it serves a deeper purpose. Delpero wants us to feel the weight of time, to experience the stillness, and to understand how grief stretches endlessly.

There are no big emotional breakdowns or dramatic plot twists. Instead, the emotions are simmering just beneath the surface, revealed in the smallest details—a hand resting on a shoulder, a glance that lingers for just a second too long, the hesitation before someone speaks. This restraint makes the emotional beats even more powerful. Vermiglio is about women who have learned to suppress their pain, and Delpero lets the audience piece those emotions together through observation rather than exposition.

### Conclusion: A Story That Lingers

Vermiglio stays with you because it doesn&apos;t demand your attention with spectacle or fast-paced action. Instead, it invites you to sit with its characters and feel their grief, their longing, and their quiet strength. At its core, it&apos;s about women navigating a world that often doesn&apos;t see them. It&apos;s about the past shaping the present, the weight of memory, and the resilience it takes to keep going when everything around you has changed.

Through stunning cinematography, restrained performances, and a deep understanding of unspoken pain, Delpero crafts a film that feels both deeply personal and universally resonant.

Vermiglio asks us to listen—to the silences, to the unsaid words, and to the stories of those who have been left behind. And in doing so, it reminds us that even in the quietest places, even in the loneliest moments, there is still life, still hope, still the possibility of something new.

## How Vermiglio (2022) Was Made

### Filmmaking Techniques

#### Cinematography & Lighting: Painting with Light

Caroline Champetier, the cinematographer (who worked on Holy Motors and Annette), really brings her expertise to Vermiglio. The landscapes, both vast and intimate, become a canvas that helps tell the story. The camera work is quiet, almost like a painting, letting the visuals carry the emotional weight of the film.

**Static Wide Shots & Minimal Movement**: A lot of the time, the camera holds a wide shot, almost still, as if letting the scene breathe. It&apos;s deliberate, mirroring the sisters&apos; isolation and their stillness in life.

**Natural Light & Muted Tones**: The soft, natural light feels like it&apos;s part of the world itself. The shadows here aren&apos;t used just for effect, they add a softness to the story, a quiet elegance.

**Framing for Isolation**: The sisters are often shown distanced from each other, even when they&apos;re in the same room. The physical separation on-screen reflects the emotional distance between them and their surroundings. One recurring visual theme is the contrast between open spaces and tight, poorly lighted rooms. The vast landscapes emphasize the idea of escape, while the close quarters of their home trap them in a kind of emotional stasis.

#### Sound Design: Silence Speaks Volumes

In Vermiglio, the sound design isn&apos;t just background noise—it&apos;s as integral to the story as the images. The absence of sound often has more weight than the moments when something is actually heard.

**Silence as Suspense**: The film stretches moments of silence, making us feel uneasy with even the smallest sounds, like a creaking floorboard or the rustle of fabric. It&apos;s not just silence—it&apos;s a kind of tension.

**Diegetic Sound Over Score**: Instead of relying on a musical score to manipulate emotions, the film leans on natural sounds—like the wind, birds, or distant church bells—to create mood. It&apos;s a grounded approach that makes the experience feel more real.

**Echoing Absence**: The way sound is mixed feels almost ghostly. There&apos;s a haunting silence where the presence of men used to be, and you hear it in the everyday moments—the lack of voices, of laughter, the stillness in daily routines. One of the most memorable moments is when the eldest sister performs a household task in total silence, the only sound being the creak of wood and the soft scratch of fabric. It feels almost ritualistic, like she&apos;s preserving a piece of the past with her actions.

#### Editing & Pacing: Taking Time with Emotion

The editing in Vermiglio, handled by Jean-Christophe Bouzy, is where the film really embraces its meditative tone. The pacing is slow and deliberate, giving space for the emotions to unfold gradually, almost like a memory.

**Lingering Cuts**: The film tends to avoid quick cuts, letting scenes play out in real-time. This draws us into the moment, making every small gesture feel heavy with meaning.

**Rhythmic Editing for Contrast**: Even though the pacing is slow overall, there are moments where the rhythm picks up, especially when emotions reach a breaking point. This subtle change in pace makes those moments stand out.

**Nonlinear Memory Fragments**: Flashbacks come in and out without clear transitions. This mirrors how memory and grief don&apos;t happen in a neat, linear fashion—they&apos;re fragmented, blending together in the present. A great example is when the youngest sister walks through the village. The editing cuts between her present journey and memories of her childhood, blurring the lines between time and reinforcing the theme of being trapped in memory.

#### Production & Set Design: A World Frozen in Time

The production design plays a key role in Vermiglio, it brings the film&apos;s themes of memory and isolation to life. The village feels like a ghost town, filled with remnants of a life that used to be.

**Minimalist, Lived-In Spaces**: The sisters&apos; home is sparse but full of history. The furniture is old, and the walls show wear and tear—every object feels like it carries a memory with it.

**Muted Color Palette**: The earthy tones—browns, blues, grays—create a sense of melancholy that echoes throughout the film. There&apos;s no bright color to distract you; everything feels muted, just like the emotions of the characters.

**Symbolic Use of Objects**: Small details—like an abandoned coat or a dusty pair of men&apos;s shoes—carry so much weight in the film. The set is full of subtle clues that speak to the sisters&apos; inner lives. One moment that stands out is when the middle sister finds a pair of men&apos;s shoes under a bed. It&apos;s never explained, but the weight of that object is felt immediately, like a reminder of a life that was once shared but is now only a memory.

### Maura Delpero&apos;s Directorial Vision: A Subtle Approach

Delpero&apos;s style is understated yet profound. She&apos;s not interested in telling the audience how to feel. Instead, she lets the emotions come through the performances and compositions.

**Subtle Performances**: The actors rely on body language and expressions more than words. It&apos;s the smallest movements—like a hand resting on a shoulder—that convey more than anything a character could say.

**Avoidance of Traditional Structure**: Vermiglio doesn&apos;t follow a typical narrative arc. It&apos;s more like a poem, with moments that feel fragmented, allowing the emotions to build slowly.

**Focus on Female Lives**: Delpero centers the quiet strength of women. There are no grand speeches or confrontations; instead, strength is shown in the smallest actions—like performing daily tasks with quiet resilience. The final shot of the film is a perfect example of Delpero&apos;s restraint. It doesn&apos;t give us a clear resolution, but it lingers long enough for the audience to interpret what&apos;s next. It&apos;s an open-ended conclusion that speaks to the power of visual storytelling.

### Conclusion: A Film That Feels Like a Poem

Vermiglio doesn&apos;t just tell a story—it creates an experience. Every choice made, from the cinematography to the sound to the pacing, contributes to a film that is quietly emotional but deeply affecting. Delpero&apos;s approach brings us into a world where grief is palpable, memory is fluid, and silence speaks louder than words.

For anyone who is willing to take their time with it, Vermiglio offers more than just a film. It becomes a meditation on loss, resilience, and the passage of time. And long after the credits roll, it lingers with you—quietly, but profoundly.
