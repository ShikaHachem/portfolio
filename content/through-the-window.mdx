  </div>

  <div className="mb-6">
    <p className="uppercase font-bold">OPENING SCENE: CAR RIDE – NIGHT</p>
    <p className="italic">Location: A moving car, soft streetlights flickering outside. The protagonist and parent are on their way home from a family gathering. The mood is heavy with tension, but it's quiet, save for the faint hum of the car.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="mb-6">
    <p className="uppercase font-bold">INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT</p>
    <p className="mb-4">The camera focuses on the protagonist's face in close-up, half-lit by the streetlights. Their expression is distant, their eyes not focused on anything in particular, but rather reflecting the quiet, scattered thoughts in their head. The car is moving through the night, and the city's sounds are faintly heard in the background.</p>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The parent, sitting in the driver's seat, is completely fixated on the road. Their hands are firmly gripping the wheel, eyes darting between the road and the rearview mirror.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(speaking loudly, trying to keep the conversation going, clearly frustrated)</p>
      <p>You need to stop being so shy. I don't get it. You have so much potential, but you just hide from it. You can't keep doing this. You'll never get anywhere if you don't change. People are always looking for someone who can fit in, who can engage.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PROTAGONIST</p>
      <p className="italic">(silent, gazing out the window)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(ignoring the protagonist's silence, voice raised slightly)</p>
      <p>I don't care what they tell you. You need to be more open, talk to people, show them who you are. You can't keep holding back, hiding in the shadows. It's not healthy! You've got talent. Why won't you just let people see it?</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The protagonist's fingers shift nervously on their lap, the camera focusing on their subtle movements—a small, unconscious gesture to calm themselves. They don't respond. Their eyes are fixed on the street outside, noticing everything—every detail.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(still focused on the road, now more insistent, trying to get through to the protagonist)</p>
      <p>People aren't going to just notice you if you don't make an effort. You can't stay in your shell forever. Life's about interacting, meeting new people. I don't know why you don't want to be a part of that. You have to learn to be a little more like everyone else. You're not going to get far if you're always so quiet.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The protagonist's eyes flicker toward the street, noticing something happening outside. A crazy person is yelling at someone in the street, completely oblivious to their surroundings.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(ignoring the shouting, still absorbed in their lecture, speaking almost to themselves)</p>
      <p>You have to understand that society needs you to be more... social. People won't understand if you're too withdrawn. You have to make them understand who you are.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PROTAGONIST</p>
      <p className="italic">(still silent, only their eyes dart toward the argument happening outside the car. They follow the movement of the crazy person's gestures, tracking the shifting dynamics of the interaction.)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The crazy person continues to shout at the sane person, who is trying to walk away but is becoming more visibly frustrated.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(not noticing the scene unfolding outside, continuing to speak as if the protagonist is listening)</p>
      <p>You have to let go of that fear, that hesitation. Why do you always think everyone is judging you? You've got so much to offer. People will appreciate you once you let them. Don't be afraid to show yourself.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The protagonist watches closely, their face more focused on the scene outside than on the parent. They watch the sane person's fist tighten, the tension in their face as they try to ignore the crazy person's shouting.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(still not noticing the tension outside)</p>
      <p>I'm just trying to help you understand. You can't stay like this forever. You need to try, even if it's uncomfortable. It's the only way things will get better. People will respect you if you show them who you are. You can't keep running away.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PROTAGONIST</p>
      <p className="italic">(eyes shift slightly, still observing the crazy person and sane person. They notice the frustration building in the sane person's body, their movements growing agitated.)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(finally taking a deep breath, trying to soften their tone)</p>
      <p>You just need to be confident. You have every right to be here. You don't need to hide away. People will like you once they get to know you. I just want you to be happy.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The camera briefly cuts to the protagonist's face. A subtle look of discomfort appears, but they don't speak. They continue to gaze out the window, lost in their observations.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(trying again, still thinking they can "fix" things, almost pleading now)</p>
      <p>You know, you could have shown them tonight. You could've tried talking to someone. Maybe next time, you can make that effort, okay?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PROTAGONIST</p>
      <p className="italic">(eyes shift away from the road, back to the scene outside. They notice a couple walking hand-in-hand, quietly discussing something, the woman looking uncertain, the man reassuring her. The protagonist takes in every detail, even the difference in their gestures.)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The camera zooms in slightly on the protagonist's face. Their eyes soften as they watch the couple, noticing the quiet tension between them—small but significant.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(still focused on the road, voice tinged with worry)</p>
      <p>It's about finding balance, you know? Not being too shy, not being too distant. You need to find a way to connect, to be seen, to not feel so out of place.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PROTAGONIST</p>
      <p className="italic">(eyes stay on the couple, no reaction, but they keep noticing the contrast in their movements, the subtle signs of difference and affection.)</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(gently, with a mix of concern and frustration)</p>
      <p>I just don't want you to miss out on life because you're too scared to get involved. You're not different, you're just... misunderstood. People want to see you, to talk to you. You just have to make the first step.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p className="mb-4">The camera pulls back slightly to show the protagonist's blank expression, their face unchanged, lost in the silent observation of the world around them. The city is outside the window—full of people, yet they remain isolated, trapped within their own mind.</p>
    
    <div className="mb-4">
      <p className="uppercase font-bold">PARENT</p>
      <p className="italic">(softly, almost resigned)</p>
      <p>Maybe you just don't see it yet. But you will, one day. I hope you understand that.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The protagonist's gaze lingers on the street as they continue their ride, their mind clearly elsewhere, noticing everything, yet saying nothing.</p>

  <div className="mt-8 mb-6">
    <p className="uppercase font-bold">PRODUCTION NOTES:</p>
    
    <p className="uppercase font-semibold mt-4">CINEMATOGRAPHY:</p>
    <p className="mb-4">Use close-ups to show the protagonist's internal silence—focus on their subtle movements (fingers, eyes). Keep the camera focused on the world outside, highlighting the details the protagonist notices that the parent misses. The wide shots emphasize the isolation of the protagonist in the midst of all the noise.</p>
    
    <p className="uppercase font-semibold mt-4">SOUND DESIGN:</p>
    <p className="mb-4">The city sounds are faint but ever-present. Use ambient noise (car engines, distant shouting) to convey the chaotic environment. The protagonist's quiet observation should contrast with the louder, more dominating sounds. There should be no inner monologue—only the world around them and the quiet hum of their own thoughts.</p>
    
    <p className="uppercase font-semibold mt-4">LIGHTING:</p>
    <p>Use the flickering streetlights to create a sense of internal fog in the protagonist's mind. The lighting is subdued, capturing the reflective, almost melancholic mood of the protagonist's experience. During moments of heightened tension, like when they observe the arguments and the couple, use contrast lighting to highlight their internal focus versus the outside chaos.</p>

## Behind the Script

This short film script explores the disconnect between internal observation and external pressure. The protagonist, while silent throughout, is acutely aware of their surroundings, noticing details and dynamics that others miss. Meanwhile, the parent, focused on "fixing" their child, misses the very awareness and perceptiveness that makes the protagonist unique.

The script aims to challenge our understanding of what constitutes meaningful engagement with the world. Is it the outward display of sociability that the parent desires? Or is it the deep, thoughtful observation that the protagonist embodies?

Visually, the script creates a contrast between the confined space of the car and the expansive world outside the window, highlighting how the protagonist feels trapped between these two worlds, unable to reconcile them.

The protagonist's silence is not emptiness, but a different form of processing—one that society often fails to value or understand. Through this character, the script invites us to reconsider our assumptions about communication, connection, and what it means to truly see the world around us.
